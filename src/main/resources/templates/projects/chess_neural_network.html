                <p>
                    Over the course of my senior year of high school, I performed an Independent Study on Artificial
                    Intelligence using Neural Networks where I wrote an deeply-connected feed-forward Artificial
                    Neural Network from scratch in Java and I taught it to play chess. This was a tremendous
                    undertaking.
                    <br /><br />
                    I started off this project by researching how Artificial Neural Networks worked and were written. I
                    learned of the underlying math and calculations that occurred in order to make a computer able to
                    learn. I read academic research papers, programmer blog posts, and wikipedia articles all detailing
                    the underlying processes allowing computers to simulate intelligence. After over a month of
                    research, I believed that I knew enough and that I had figured out enough of the math in order to
                    write my own Neural Network. This simple network was just a starting point for me to learn how to go
                    about writing a Neural Network and for me to play around with some of the parameters that I would
                    later have to spend a lot of time fine-tuning. I taught this first simple network the
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exclusive_or">XOR function</a>.
                    <br /><br />
                    After it was able to learn this function with a fairly high success rate (90% of random starts), I
                    decided that it was time to switch to a more complex task: Chess. While I recognized that this would
                    be an immense challenge and I even doubted my own ability to be able to write a neural network that
                    would be able to do anything from my fairly surface-level understanding of all of the concepts
                    behind all that I was doing, I was determined to take my failures and convert them to successes, to
                    increase my understanding and learn how to write a neural network that I never thought I could.
                    <br /><br />
                    So next, I downloaded 18,313 games of chess from 12 different chess masters in order to use to train
                    my network. After writing the code that I'd need to be able to read these chess trascripts and
                    convert them into a form that would be usable for my neural network, I reworked my code in order to
                    be able to handle and better process this tremendous volume of data. Over the course of the rest of
                    the school year, I worked on improving my algorithm and changing the size of the neural network. I
                    spent it fixing bugs that I kepts discovering and optimizing the methods that I was using to teach
                    the Neural Network chess. The end of the year came before it was able to fully learn to play chess.
                    While it never truly learned to play chess it did manage to memorize the first 7 moves of a couple
                    of different openings. It was also able to change which opening it would use depending on what moves
                    its opponent made. Then I presented my results to a related class, in my case the AP Computer
                    Science A class, and I called it a year. I do still plan on returning to this project. Probably
                    using a library, such as TensorFlow, just to see if it was my data or my algorithm that were at
                    fault for this result.
