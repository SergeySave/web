                    In the spring of my junior year of high school, I had gotten interested in 3-dimensional graphics
                    and how your computer rendered them to your screen. I decided that I would make a project that used
                    3D graphics techniques in order to render a 3D planet in real time. This project, written in Java
                    using LibGDX to provide me access to OpenGL functions, started off with me simply drawing a 3D cube
                    to the screen and then being able to rotate the camera around it. After I completed this relatively
                    easy task, I set on to replace the cube with a planet.
                    <br /><br />
                    First I cut up each face of the cube into smaller subfaces. Each of the six faces on my cube was cut
                    into five hundred and twelve columns and each of those columns into another five hundred and twelve
                    rows. This left me with nearly one and a half million squares collectively making up a cube. I then
                    took all of the vertices from these squares and I moved them inwards so that they were all an equal
                    distance away from the center of the cube. I had made a sphere. However, the points on this sphere
                    were more uniformly distributed than those on a sphere where an equal amount of points were placed
                    at every latitude. I then gave each point a unique random offset generated by an open source version
                    of the simplex noise function. This gave my sphere bumps and edges. I then colored points offset
                    towards the center blue and those offset away green. I had made a planet (of sorts), but it did not
                    meet my expectations. It would take my program approximately a minute to generate all of the points
                    and send them to my GPU in order to render a much lower quality version of the planet than I had
                    hoped to make while running slower than real-time.
                    <br /><br />
                    I realized that I needed to change something big if I wanted different results. A couple academic
                    research papers later, I realized what I needed to do. I needed to implement a level of detail
                    algorithm. This algorithm would change the amount of points that it was using to render the planet
                    as it was rendering the planet to simultaneously offer greatly improved performance and greatly
                    improved quality. After figuring how these algorithms worked in general and failing to understand
                    any specifics about any algorithm, I set on to devise my own. About a week later I had succeeded.
                    I wrote a quad tree that would wrap correctly around the edges of my cube. Then I would take these
                    nodes that the quad tree gave me and I would connect their edges up with triangles in order to
                    generate the mesh that I used for rendering. Then I was able to split one of these nodes if I wanted
                    a region of the planet to be in higher quality or recombine four child nodes back into a parent node
                    if I wanted to increase the performance. After this was completed, I had achieved much better
                    performance and quality than I originally had with the first version of my planet. I was able to
                    zoom in all the way into the planet and I still would not be able to discern massive triangles in
                    my planet. However, it still didn't work as well as I had hoped, but I learned a lot from it and the
                    academic papers that I had read finally clicked after I had finished the project.
