            In the spring of my junior year of high school, I had gotten interested in 3-dimensional graphics
            and how your computer rendered them to your screen. I decided that I would make a project that used
            3D graphics techniques in order to render a 3D planet in real time. This project, written in Java
            using LibGDX to provide me access to OpenGL functions, started off with me simply drawing a 3D cube
            to the screen and then being able to rotate the camera around it. After I completed this relatively
            easy task, I set on to replace the cube with a planet.

             data-content="A screenshot of the rendering produced by the planet renderer program. As you can see the mountains in the background are much more jagged than the terrain closer to the view. The colors are set from the height of the terrain.">

            First I cut up each face of the cube into smaller subfaces. Each of the six faces on my cube was cut
            into five hundred and twelve columns and each of those columns into another five hundred and twelve
            rows. This left me with nearly one and a half million squares collectively making up a cube. I then
            took all of the vertices from these squares and I moved them inwards so that they were all an equal
            distance away from the center of the cube. I had made a sphere. However, the points on this sphere
            were more uniformly distributed than those on a sphere where an equal amount of points were placed
            at every latitude. I then gave each point a unique random offset generated by an open source version
            of the simplex noise function. This gave my sphere bumps and edges. I then colored points offset
            towards the center blue and those offset away green. I had made a planet (of sorts), but it did not
            meet my expectations. It would take my program approximately a minute to generate all of the points
            and send them to my GPU in order to render a much lower quality version of the planet than I had
            hoped to make while running slower than real-time.

        <div class="activating element" data-position="top right" data-content="A screenshot of the rendering produced by the planet renderer program with wireframe mode
                            turned on. With this it is visible how the land in the background has less triangles than
                            the land in the foreground. The transitions between different levels of detail are also
                            visible.">

            I realized that I needed to change something big if I wanted different results. A couple academic
            research papers later, I realized what I needed to do. I needed to implement a level of detail
            algorithm. This algorithm would change the amount of points that it was using to render the planet
            as it was rendering the planet to simultaneously offer greatly improved performance and greatly
            improved quality. After figuring how these algorithms worked in general and failing to understand
            any specifics about any algorithm, I set on to devise my own. About a week later I had succeeded.
            I wrote a quad tree that would wrap correctly around the edges of my cube. Then I would take these
            nodes that the quad tree gave me and I would connect their edges up with triangles in order to
            generate the mesh that I used for rendering. Then I was able to split one of these nodes if I wanted
            a region of the planet to be in higher quality or recombine four child nodes back into a parent node
            if I wanted to increase the performance. After this was completed, I had achieved much better
            performance and quality than I originally had with the first version of my planet. I was able to
            zoom in all the way into the planet and I still would not be able to discern massive triangles in
            my planet. However, it still didn't work as well as I had hoped, but I learned a lot from it and the
            academic papers that I had read finally clicked after I had finished the project.
